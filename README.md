# Event-Manager-Web
The Web portion of the Event Manager for the SEG4910 Capstone Project.

The repository for the Android app can be found <a href="https://github.com/AlexandreStelzig/Event-Manager-Android">here</a> and the IOS app can be found <a href="">here</a>

The goal for this project is to create an open source event manager that can be used by groups or organisations to plan events and 
workshops as well as creating an easy-to-use registration form for the events.
